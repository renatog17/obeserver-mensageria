# Observer Pattern API

This project implements the Observer Pattern in a Spring Boot application. It allows different services (observers) to subscribe and receive messages from a central service (subject). The goal is to demonstrate the concept of the Observer Pattern by using WebSockets or HTTP to notify all subscribed services about certain events.
